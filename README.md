# Youtube Interface | React + Vite, Redux & YouTube Data API v3 

![banner](banner.png)

> Cloning the Youtube interface using one of the services provided by the `Google Cloud`, the `YouTube Data API v3`
in which it is possible to get the data from Youtube videos in real time. The `Redux Toolkit and Axios` libraries were used
to perform requests, process data and manage the state of requests. Also implemented `Infinite Scroll`
which causes the `getHomePageVideos` or `getSearchPageVideos` function to make a new request with the `pageToken` parameter to
retrieve an additional page of results.
